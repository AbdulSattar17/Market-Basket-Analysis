Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm
This project demonstrates Market Basket Analysis using Association Analysis with the Apriori Algorithm. The goal is to find hidden patterns in transactional data. The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and represents transactions from a UK retailer from 2010-2011, primarily sales to wholesalers.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pandas
MLxtend

You can install the required packages using:
pip install pandas mlxtend

Data
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The file should be named Online_Retail.csv.

Installing
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AbdulSattar17/market-basket-analysis.git

Results
The analysis reveals that items such as green and red alarm clocks, as well as red paper cups, napkins, and plates, are frequently purchased together more often than would be expected by chance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of the Apriori algorithm for Market Basket Analysis. The results can help retailers understand the buying patterns of their customers, which can be used to inform marketing strategies and inventory management.
